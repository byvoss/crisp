# CRISP Documentation

> Code Rules for Intuitive Semantic Projects

## Welcome to CRISP

CRISP is both a CSS methodology and a framework that solves the complexity crisis in modern CSS. It prioritises semantic HTML, minimal classes, and accessibility-first design.

## Core Principles at a Glance

1. **Semantic HTML First** - Use real elements, not div soup
2. **Rule of Three** - 1 component + 1 layout + max 3 properties
3. **Custom Properties for Variants** - Not modifier classes
4. **Meaningful Prefixes** - None, `as-`, or `with-`
5. **Embrace the Cascade** - Work with CSS, not against it

## Three Levels of CRISP

- **CRISP** (~50KB) - Pure CSS framework
- **CRISP Theme** (~60KB) - Adds theme switching
- **CRISP Enterprise** (~150KB) - Adds TypeScript & i18n

Same HTML works at all levels. Start simple, enhance as needed.
